<h1>0x1D. C - Binary trees </h1>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>A binary tree is a data structure that is made up of nodes. Each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A binary tree can be used to store data in a hierarchical manner, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. Binary trees are commonly used in computer science for a variety of tasks, such as storing data in a sorted order, implementing efficient search algorithms, and more.</p>
<h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>What is a binary tree</li>
<li>What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree</li>
<li>What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists</li>
<li>What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree</li>
<li>What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree</li>
<li>What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>All files were created and compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on gcc 4.8.4
using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic</li>
<li>All files were linted for syntax and style with Betty</li>
</ul>
